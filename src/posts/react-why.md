## Why React ?

### React: Not Bad, But Not the End-All, Be-All

Let's be real – most companies follow the herd, not the cutting edge. React's popularity is a classic example. Sure, it's a decent library, but it's far from the holy grail of frontend development.

Once a corporation's succumbed to the React hype, they're trapped. Refactoring that monstrous codebase? Yeah, good luck with that budget request. It ain't happening, folks.

And let's talk libraries. Yes, the React ecosystem is teeming with them. And you know what else teems with stuff? A swamp. Bugs, my friend. Bugs galore. Oh, and don't forget how those handy libraries bloat your bundle size into oblivion. This is why React isn't a framework – it's a glorified dependency magnet. It'S a LibRaRy, NoT A fRaMEwoRk!

And let's not forget the legions of React fan-folk. They've sunk so much time into their favorite tool, the idea of exploring other options is unthinkable. Blind devotion, anyone?

But hey, here's the upside: the world's overflowing with React legacy code. Job security for devs willing to wade through the mess!
