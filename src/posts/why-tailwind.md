## Everyone hates Tailwind, until they don't

### "I hate Tailwind, it's so ugly"

I've heard this a lot. And I get it. I really do. When I first saw Tailwind, I thought it was the ugliest thing I'd ever seen. But then I started using it, and I realized how powerful it is.

To make it less ugly, you can use two simple tricks:

- [Prettier plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier) to enforce consistent class ordering
- [Tailwind Plugins](https://dev.to/jeetvora331/must-have-tailwindcss-plugins-fl0)

Also, it is not so bad if you are using front-end frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular. Components are a great way to abstract away the ugly classes.

### "But I can't remember all the classes"

- Use a [cheat sheet](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet).
- Use [IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) in your editor.
- Use inspector tools to see design system CSS variables in :root. Tailwind 4 is based on CSS variables, so you can see all the classes in the inspector. Plus, you can change them on the fly to see how it affects your design or add custom ones to your Tailwind theme.

### "Why not just use Bootstrap?"

- Tailwind is more flexible. You can create your own design system with it.
- Tailwind is more performant. You only use the classes you need.
- Tailwind is more maintainable. You can easily change your design system by changing one file.
- Tailwind is more accessible. You can use it with any front-end framework or even vanilla HTML.

### "Why not just use inline styles?"

This question is so frequent that official Tailwind documentation has a [whole section](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first#why-not-just-use-inline-styles) dedicated to it.

## Why I love Tailwind

### 1. **Speed**

Tailwind is by far the fastest way to build a website. You don't have to write any CSS. You just add classes to your HTML, and you're done. Also, you don't have to worry about naming things, which can be a huge time saver.

### 2. **Flexibility**

Tailwind is incredibly flexible. You can create your own design system with it. You can easily change your design system by changing one file. With Tailwind 4 this is even easier because it is based on CSS variables.

### 3. **Performance**

Tailwind is very performant. You only use the classes you need. This means your CSS is smaller, and your website loads faster.

### 4. **Scalability**

Tailwind is very scalable. You can use it on small projects or large projects. You can easily scale your design system with Tailwind. Utility-first CSS scales better than traditional CSS because you don't have to worry about specificity issues. Also your bundle size is smaller because you only use the classes you need.

### 5. **Browser support**

Tailwind has great browser support. It works in all modern browsers. You don't have to worry about compatibility issues with Tailwind.

## Conclusion

Don't knock it till you try it. Tailwind is a powerful tool that can help you build websites faster, more flexibly, and more accessibly. Give it a shot, and you might just fall in love with it like I did.
